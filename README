## Description

Mathdown merges markdown and Latex's math mode syntax in order to provide a simple and fast way for mathematical notetaking. You can write a markdown file as usual and simply use Latex's math commands without any further declaration (like \$ signs) in the text. Mathdown has heuristics to detect this, interprets it as math and outputs a nice .pdf as well as a .tex with your notes.

This tiny, but useful piece of software is [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) licensed.

## Usage

The input files have by convention the extension .mdma. With the mathdown script in your PATH, in order to create a pdf from the file `example.mdma`, just type

`mathdown example`

and the .tex as well as .pdf will be generated in the same folder.

For a very simple example file, see the [Info.mdma] in this repository.

## Components and Installation

Mathdown consists of a python script `markmath.py` to detect the math commands heuristically and mark them for the markdown compiler and a bash script `mathdown` that uses [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to compile the .tex and .pdf file from the input. It requires working commands `pandoc`, `pdflatex`, and python 3.

When downloading the files from this repository you can simply run `install.sh` to copy the few required files where they belong for the user running the script. The main script `mathdown` is tried to move to /usr/bin/ as well, which works only when you're allowed to sudo. Otherwise you can do that manually or put the file wherever you want. In your home folder a `.mdma` folder is created, containing the python script `markmath.py` and a custom latex template you can modify or enrich with your personal commands.
